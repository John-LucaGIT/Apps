# Apps
Currently just some small apps / "doodles". 

## By20XX
- A simple web app created using Vue.js for users to add goals they want to achieve by a certain year. 
The idea came to me because... I thought hey, that might be neat. So here it is.

### What I want this to become
- My plan is to make this public and similar to hastebin, people should be able to without an account create goals, save them to a unique URL 
and access them at any later date. This way goals are "forever" online so you don't forget about them, and you can share your goals with friends. 
I also plan to implement a feature where you enter the URL "by20xx.com/random" and you get a random persons goal. So you can stalk peoples goals I guess. 

Let me know if you have feedback or any advice on how to best go forward with the app :) .
