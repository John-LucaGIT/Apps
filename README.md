# [BY20XX](https://by20xx.com)
- A simple web app created using Vue.js for users to add goals they want to achieve by a certain year.
The idea came to me because... I thought hey, that might be neat. So here it is.

### About
- The idea of the App is inspired by and similar to hastebin, people are able to create goals without an account and save them to a unique URL
to access at any later date. This way goals are "forever" online so you don't forget about them, and you can share your goals with friends.
I also plan to implement a feature where you enter the URL "by20xx.com/random" and you get a random persons goal. So you can stalk peoples goals I guess.

Let me know if you have feedback or any advice on how to best go forward with the app :) .
